# little-coder

**A coding agent tuned for small local models, built on top of [pi](https://pi.dev).**

The research story behind all this — why scaffold–model fit matters, how a 9.7 B Qwen beat frontier entries on Aider Polyglot, and what the load-bearing mechanisms actually do — is written up on Substack: **[*Honey, I Shrunk the Coding Agent*](https://open.substack.com/pub/itayinbarr/p/honey-i-shrunk-the-coding-agent)**. Start there if you want the "why"; stay here for the "how".

## How it relates to pi

[pi](https://pi.dev) is the minimal substrate — agent loop, multi-provider API, TUI, session tree, compaction, extension model. Four built-in tools (read / write / edit / bash) and a ~1000-token system prompt.

little-coder is **pi + 20 extensions + 30 skill markdown files + a Python benchmark harness**. It doesn't fork pi or shadow its CLI — pi is a plain dependency in `package.json`, and everything little-coder-specific lives under `.pi/extensions/`, `skills/`, and `benchmarks/`. The launcher runs pi with `--no-extensions` and wires in exactly the bundled set, so you add your own extension by dropping a directory into `.pi/extensions/` (or passing `little-coder -e /path/to/ext/index.ts` at launch) and remove one of ours by deleting its directory. Note this also means a globally `pi install`'d package won't load inside little-coder — `pi install` registers into pi's settings, which `--no-extensions` skips.

If you've never used pi, it's useful to skim [pi.dev](https://pi.dev) first — the rest of this doc assumes pi's model of `--agent-import-path`, `--mode rpc`, and `.pi/extensions/` auto-discovery.

## Install

One-line install (Node.js 22.19+ required):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or with npm directly:

```bash
npm install -g little-coder
```

Or with [bun](https://bun.sh):

```bash
bun add -g little-coder
```

That's the whole install. No clone, no `npm install` in a workspace, no PATH fiddling. `little-coder` is now on your PATH and works from any directory.

> **Note for `bun add -g` users.** The launcher (`bin/little-coder.mjs`) is a Node.js script with `#!/usr/bin/env node` at the top, so Node ≥ 22.19 still has to be on your PATH for the binary to start — bun is fine for installing/updating the package, but the runtime is Node. If you want a fully node-less setup, replace the shebang in `$(bun pm bin -g)/little-coder` with `#!/usr/bin/env bun`.

## Run

```bash
cd ~/your-project
little-coder --model llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
```

This is the canonical setup little-coder is tuned for: a local llama.cpp server hosting Qwen3.6-35B-A3B. See **[Local model setup (optional)](#local-model-setup-optional)** below for how to serve it.

Cloud models work the same way:

```bash
little-coder --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
little-coder --model openai/gpt-4o-mini "What does this codebase do?"
little-coder --model ollama/qwen3.5             # local Ollama
little-coder --model lmstudio/local-model       # local LM Studio (whatever model you have loaded)
little-coder --list-models                      # see everything pi knows about
```

The agent uses the directory you launched it from as its working directory — `Read` / `Write` / `Edit` / `Bash` operate on your project, not on little-coder's install path.

For local providers (llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio) pi expects *some* value in the API-key env even though local servers ignore it:

```bash
export LLAMACPP_API_KEY=noop
export OLLAMA_API_KEY=noop
export LMSTUDIO_API_KEY=noop
```

`LLAMACPP_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, and `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` override the defaults (`http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1`, `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`, `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`).

For cloud providers, set the standard env (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) and pi will discover it.

## Local model setup (optional)

Skip this section if you're using a cloud model.

**Option A — llama.cpp** (fastest for local; supports Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE):

```bash
# One-time: build llama.cpp with CUDA (sm_XXX = your GPU arch; Blackwell = 120)
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120 -DLLAMA_CURL=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j

# Fetch the model GGUF and the matching vision projector.
# The mmproj (~900 MB) is what lets the model see attached screenshots.
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir ~/models
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF mmproj-F16.gguf            --local-dir ~/models

# Serve it (MoE trick: experts in RAM, attention on GPU → 22 GB model on 8 GB VRAM)
build/bin/llama-server -m ~/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf \
   --mmproj ~/models/mmproj-F16.gguf \
   --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --jinja \
   -c 16384 -ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 999 --flash-attn on
```

If you only need text and want to skip the projector download, drop the second `hf download` line and the `--mmproj` flag — little-coder still works text-only, but the TUI's image attachment will be rejected by the server with a 4xx.

**Option B — Ollama** (simpler, but slower on MoE):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull qwen3.5        # 9.7B — the paper's model
# or: ollama pull qwen3.6-35b-a3b
```

**Option C — LM Studio** (GUI; OpenAI-compatible server on port 1234):

1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and download a model (e.g. Qwen3.6 35B A3B GGUF).
2. Open the **Developer** / **Local Server** tab, load the model, and click **Start Server** (default `http://127.0.0.1:1234`).
3. Run little-coder:
   ```bash
   export LMSTUDIO_API_KEY=noop
   little-coder --model lmstudio/local-model
   ```
   The shipped `lmstudio/local-model` id routes to whatever model LM Studio currently has loaded — no extra config needed for the single-model case. If you serve on a non-default port, set `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1`. To target a specific model when you have several loaded, add an entry to `~/.config/little-coder/models.json` (see **Configuring models** below).

**Serving from another machine on your LAN.** Each provider's `*_BASE_URL` env var accepts any host, not just `127.0.0.1`, so you can run inference on a beefier box and connect from a laptop or another device on the same WiFi.

On the **server** (the box with the GPU):

- *llama.cpp*: start `llama-server` with `--host 0.0.0.0` (or your specific LAN interface) instead of `127.0.0.1`. Everything else from Option A unchanged.
- *LM Studio*: in the Server tab, enable **Serve on local network** so it binds `0.0.0.0:1234` instead of `127.0.0.1:1234`.
- *Ollama*: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve` (or set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` in the user systemd unit).
- If `ufw` / `firewalld` is active, allow your LAN subnet to the relevant port (e.g. `sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 8888 proto tcp`).
- Find the LAN IP with `hostname -I` (Linux) or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (macOS).

On the **client** (the machine running little-coder):

```bash
# Pick the env vars matching whichever provider is running on the server
export LLAMACPP_API_KEY=noop
export LLAMACPP_BASE_URL=http://<server-lan-ip>:8888/v1

# Sanity check reachability before launching the agent
curl -s http://<server-lan-ip>:8888/v1/models | head

little-coder --model llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
```

The streaming chat-completions adapter works over a local network the same way it does over loopback — no client code change, no proxy needed. The per-model profile in `.pi/settings.json` (context/thinking-budget/temperature) still applies because it's keyed by `<provider>/<model-id>`, which the client picks regardless of where the server lives.

All small-model-specific extensions auto-disable for large/cloud models so they don't interfere.

---

## Configuring models

The shipped model list lives in **`models.json`** at the package root. The `llama-cpp-provider` extension reads it at startup and registers each provider via pi's `registerProvider()`. Editing this file in your global install **does** take effect — but it's overwritten on `npm install -g little-coder@latest`, so for anything you want to keep, use a user override file instead.

User override resolution (first match wins):

1. `$LITTLE_CODER_MODELS_FILE` — explicit path, useful for ad-hoc tests.
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/little-coder/models.json`
3. `~/.config/little-coder/models.json`

Merge semantics: each top-level provider key in your override file **fully replaces** the same key in the shipped `models.json`. Providers only in your file are added; providers only in the shipped file are kept. (We don't deep-merge per-model fields — you redeclare the whole provider entry, which avoids "your override silently inherited new fields from a future package release" surprises.)

Example — switch the llama.cpp port and bump `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` to a 150K context, leave ollama untouched:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "llamacpp": {
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1",
      "apiKey": "LLAMACPP_API_KEY",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "qwen3.6-35b-a3b",
          "name": "Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (local llama.cpp, 150K)",
          "reasoning": true,
          "input": ["text"],
          "contextWindow": 150000,
          "maxTokens": 4096,
          "cost": { "input": 0, "output": 0, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0 }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then verify with `little-coder --list-models` — you should see your overridden entry.

`LLAMACPP_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, and `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` env vars still beat both files for those three providers.

### Any OpenAI-compatible server (e.g. MLX / omlx)

little-coder registers providers from `models.json` — it doesn't pick up pi's standalone "picker" extensions. So a server isn't added by installing its pi picker; you add it by declaring a provider. Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works this way, including Apple's MLX server (`mlx_lm.server`, often surfaced as **omlx**). Drop this into `~/.config/little-coder/models.json` and pick it with `little-coder --model omlx/<id>`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "omlx": {
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1",
      "apiKey": "IGNORED",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "Qwen3-32B-4bit",
          "name": "Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (local omlx, 150K)",
          "reasoning": true,
          "input": ["text"],
          "contextWindow": 150000,
          "maxTokens": 4096,
          "cost": { "input": 0, "output": 0, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0 }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Set `id` to whatever model your server reports, and `baseUrl` to its `/v1` endpoint. Verify with `little-coder --list-models`.

`.pi/settings.json` is a separate concern: it controls per-model **profiles** (context_limit, thinking_budget, temperature, benchmark_overrides) referenced by the `<provider>/<id>` key. Profiles don't register or describe models — they only tune how little-coder runs against models that are already registered.

---

## Permissions

little-coder gates `Bash` tool calls against a built-in safe-prefix whitelist (`ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `git log/status/diff`, `find`, `grep`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `touch`, etc.) before pi's own confirmation flow ever sees them. `rm` and `sudo` are intentionally not on the list — add them via `LITTLE_CODER_BASH_ALLOW` per deployment if you really need them.

Two env vars control the gate:

| Env var | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `LITTLE_CODER_PERMISSION_MODE` | `auto` *(default)* / `accept-all` / `manual` | `auto`: block any bash command not on the whitelist. `accept-all`: skip the gate entirely, every bash call passes (the benchmark runner sets this). `manual`: same as `auto` but with a different rejection message. |
| `LITTLE_CODER_BASH_ALLOW` | comma-separated prefixes | Extra allow-prefixes merged with the built-in list. **Trailing whitespace is meaningful**: `"make "` allows `make test` but not `makefoo`; `"make"` allows both. |

Examples:

```bash
# Add 'make' (with word-boundary) and 'docker compose ps' on top of the defaults
export LITTLE_CODER_BASH_ALLOW="make ,docker compose ps"

# Skip the gate entirely (use this only inside controlled environments)
export LITTLE_CODER_PERMISSION_MODE=accept-all
```

Write/Edit confirmations are pi's responsibility; little-coder doesn't intercept those.

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 — wide benchmark baseline: complete.** The paper established that scaffold–model fit moves a 9.7 B model from 19 % to 45 % on Aider Polyglot, and the goal of Phase 1 was to find out how wide that impact radius is. We now have a four-benchmark baseline on a single laptop-class GPU:

1. **Aider Polyglot** — 45.56 % (paper, Qwen3.5-9B) and 78.67 % (v0.0.5, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B).
2. **Terminal-Bench-Core v0.1.1** — 40.0 % (v0.1.4).
3. **Terminal-Bench 2.0** — accepted to the [official leaderboard](https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0): Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at **24.6 % ± 3.2** (rank 120) and Qwen3.5-9B at **9.2 % ± 2.4** (rank 142). The v0.1.24 prompt-repetition fix (re-add tool descriptions + concision guideline, validated by a 4 / 4 pilot on the previously-regressing `prove-plus-comm` task) was the prompt for both submissions.
4. **GAIA** — validation set at v0.1.27: **40.00 %** (66 / 165) on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B. Per-level L1 60.4 % / L2 37.2 % / L3 7.7 %.

That spans short coding exercises (Polyglot), interactive shell-bound tasks (Terminal-Bench), and tool-using research (GAIA), all on the same scaffold. The data needed to choose what to fix next is now in hand.

**Phase 2 — operating real knowledge bases as day-to-day work: the current focus.** The motivating question shifts from *how wide is the impact radius?* to *can a small local model reliably operate and traverse a large, messy knowledge base?* little-coder's day-to-day target is now real work over **many markdown files at once** — reading, cross-referencing, and updating sprawling note/log collections in the most token-efficient way a small local model can manage. Features are being implemented and tested across several real pipelines in parallel:

- **Domains** — medical, athletic, and educational knowledge bases, each with its own structure, vocabulary, and citation needs.
- **Scale** — 10+ years of logs, tens of thousands of entries of varied kinds, stressing retrieval, compaction, and the context-budgeting extensions on histories far longer than any single benchmark task.
- **Messy real-world inputs** — validation against conflicting OCR extractions of the same source, and multilingual content where the same fact recurs across languages.

This is where the scaffolding work now compounds: knowledge injection/selection, evidence handling, compaction fidelity, and the harness-intervention behaviors. Expect smaller, more frequent releases driven by what little-coder actually struggles with on this work rather than by a benchmark suite.

**Benchmarks (deferred).** The four-benchmark baseline above stands as the scaffold-fit reference point. Fresh runs — **ProgramBench**, SWE-bench Verified (multi-file real-world patches), a GAIA test split — come back into scope once the knowledge-base work has produced enough scaffolding signal to make a new measurement worth running.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`little-coder: command not found`** — npm's global bin directory isn't on your PATH. Run `npm config get prefix` to see where it installed; add `<prefix>/bin` to your PATH. Or reinstall with `sudo` if your prefix needs root.

**`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8888`** — llama.cpp isn't running. Start `llama-server` first, or switch `--model` to an Ollama/cloud ID.

**LAN client times out (no `RST`, just hangs)** — the inference box's firewall is dropping the SYN. The usual cause is `ufw` with a default-deny policy that allow-lists only SSH / a few dev ports. From the server: `sudo ufw status verbose` to confirm; `sudo ufw allow from <your-lan-subnet>/24 to any port 8888 proto tcp` to fix (scoped to the LAN so you're not exposing the box). Docker-published ports bypass `ufw` via `PREROUTING` NAT, which is why a Docker container can be reachable while a plain `llama-server` on the same host isn't.

**Image attachment is accepted but the request returns 4xx** — your llama-server is running without a vision projector. Re-launch it with `--mmproj ~/models/mmproj-F16.gguf` (or another mmproj variant from the same GGUF repo). The `--list-models` `images` column reflects what the client *will attempt to send*, not what the server can answer; the projector is what gives the model eyes.

**`Failed to parse input at pos N: SomeTool(arg='…')]<|tool_call_end|>` (LFM2 / Liquid models)** — the model is emitting its native *Pythonic* tool calls (`<|tool_call_start|>[Read(path='…')]<|tool_call_end|>`), but llama.cpp's tool-call parser is choking on them — usually because the **chat template doesn't match the parser**. The GGUF's *embedded* template often renders tools as a plain `List of tools: […]` blob without the `<|tool_list_start|>` / `<|tool_call_start|>` special tokens the parser expects. Fix: serve with `--jinja` and the model's **proper** chat template, e.g. `llama-server -m LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf --jinja --chat-template-file LFM2-8B-A1B.jinja` (templates ship under `llama.cpp/models/templates/`). With the matching template, llama.cpp parses the calls into native `tool_calls` and tools execute normally — verified end-to-end with LFM2.5-8B-A1B. If your build still leaks the calls as plain text, little-coder's `output-parser` recognizes the format and surfaces this same diagnostic instead of a cryptic error (issue [#42](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/42)).

**No API key env var warning** — pi expects *some* key even for local providers. Export `LLAMACPP_API_KEY=noop` (or `OLLAMA_API_KEY=noop`) before launching.

**No pi "Update Available" banner** — that's intentional. little-coder defaults `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` so the bundled pi runtime doesn't nag about updating itself; little-coder pins pi to a known-good version per release. If you actually want the banner back, `export PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=0` before launching.

**Extension load failures on startup** — run `little-coder --list-models --verbose`; extension errors surface there. If the install looks corrupt: `npm uninstall -g little-coder && npm install -g little-coder`.

**Node version too old** — little-coder needs Node ≥ 22.19.0 (matching the minimum of the bundled `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` v0.75+). Check with `node --version`. Easiest fix: `nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`.

---

## Developing little-coder locally

If you want to hack on the extensions or skills:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder.git
cd little-coder
npm install
npm link            # makes the local checkout available as `little-coder`
little-coder --model llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
```

To unlink: `npm unlink -g little-coder`.

The benchmarks harness (`benchmarks/`) is dev-only and not shipped with the npm package. Run it from a clone with `python3 benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py …` etc.

```

**Key invariant.** pi is a minimal base by design. Every little-coder mechanism ships as a pi extension that hooks pi's lifecycle events (`before_agent_start`, `context`, `before_provider_request`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `turn_end`, `session_compact`). Extensions are independent: the launcher discovers every `.pi/extensions/*/index.ts` and loads it explicitly with `--extension`, and pi runs with `--no-extensions`, so the bundled set is exactly what loads — no more, no less. If you don't want one, delete its directory; if you want to add another, drop it next to the existing ones (or pass `-e <path>` at launch).

## Reproducing the paper (v0.0.2)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder.git
cd little-coder
git checkout v0.0.2
# Follow that version's README for its Python setup (pip install -e .)
```

The paper ran `ollama/qwen3.5` through the Python little-coder at commit **`1d62bde`** (tag [`v0.0.2`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.0.2)). The 45.56 % mean figure is the average of two full 225-exercise runs on that exact codebase. For the 78.67 % headline, check out tag [`v0.0.5`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.0.5) — both are pre-pi Python and follow the pre-pi setup.

## Attribution

little-coder v0.0.x was a derivative work of [CheetahClaws / ClawSpring](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring) by SafeRL-Lab, Apache 2.0. That upstream provided the Python agent substrate, tool system, multi-provider support, and REPL.

little-coder v0.1.0+ replaces that substrate with **[pi](https://pi.dev)** by Mario Zechner — Apache 2.0 / MIT. The npm package was renamed from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` in upstream's 0.74 release; little-coder v1.4.2+ ships with the new package. pi provides the agent loop, provider abstraction, TUI, and extension model. little-coder rebuilds its small-model adaptations on top of pi as extensions.

All little-coder-specific mechanisms — Write-vs-Edit invariant, skill / knowledge injection, thinking-budget cap, output-parser, quality-monitor, per-model profiles, per-benchmark overrides, ShellSession / Browser / Evidence tool families, evidence-aware compaction — are preserved across versions.
